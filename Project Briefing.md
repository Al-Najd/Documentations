In today's fast-paced world, the pursuit of productivity and the establishment of positive habits are paramount. The Al Najd iOS application embodies this ethos by gamifying daily Islamic practices, aiming to make them more engaging and rewarding for users.

# **The Power of Habit Formation**

Habits are behaviors repeated regularly, often becoming automatic over time. They play a crucial role in shaping our daily lives and overall well-being. Research suggests that, on average, it takes about 66 days for a new behavior to become a habit, though this can vary significantly among individuals.

# **Gamification: Merging Play with Productivity**

Gamification involves integrating game-like elements into non-game contexts to boost engagement and motivation. In the realm of habit formation, gamification can transform mundane tasks into enjoyable activities, thereby increasing the likelihood of adherence. For instance, incorporating rewards, challenges, and progress tracking can make the process of building new habits more interactive and fulfilling.
